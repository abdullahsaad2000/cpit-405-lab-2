    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standardized markup language used for creating the structure and presenting the content of web pages. It is the backbone of the World Wide Web and defines the elements and their arrangement within a web page.

  <p>
    HTML uses a system of tags to mark up different parts of a document, indicating their purpose and how they should be displayed in a web browser. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and typically come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The content of a web page is placed between these tags, forming elements.
